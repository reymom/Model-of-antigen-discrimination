# Model-of-antigen-discrimination
Work for the subject Systems Biology (Complex systems) where I analize the main scheme for the activation of T-cells, i.e the response of the immunitary system, and explore its features and improved modifications.

## Content
-Programs (.py) for the Kinetic Proofreading (KP) scheme applied for the antigen discrimination, for 2 and 6 steps (it can be changed in the main functions, just adding more steps).

-Programs (.py) for the modified KP scheme, with positive and negative feedback loops, for 2 and 6 steps as before.

-Programs (.py) for plotting and analizing the main responses, and others for scan the phase space.

-Written work (PDF) with all explanations, graphics and references. Guide for the matter in question.
